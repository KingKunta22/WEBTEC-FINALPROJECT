                <p>When writing algorithms, some or all of the following situations may arise:</p>
                <p class="lessons"><strong> 1. Sequence Structure. </strong> Two or more tasks are to be carried out in sequence.</p>
                <P class="lessons"><strong>2. Selection Structure. </strong> One or two tasks are to be selected depending on a specified condition. One or two tasks may be to do nothing.</P>
                <p class="lessons"><strong>3. Repetition Structure. </strong>A task is to be carried out repeatedly. </p>

                <p class="sentence">These three control structures are referred to as <b class="bold">structured programming constructs</b>. Any 
                    algorithm can be written by using only these constructs.</p>
                <p>Algorithms written with only the sequence, selection, and repetition structures are called <b class="bold">structured algorithms</b>. The process of writing such algorithms is called <b class="bold"> structured programming</b> and the 
                        resulting programs are called <b class="bold">structured programs</b>. </p>

            The selection structure and the repetition structure may also be viewed as tasks in a sequence structure.Hence, a program may be taken as a sequence of a mixture of sequence, selection and repetition structures. Note that there is always <b class="bold">1 entry point</b> and <b class="bold">1 exit point</b> in each structure. This gives us a way of writing our programs in modules.
