            <p class="create">Here are the basic rules for creating an identifier or variables:</p>
            
        </div>
        
        <ol type ="1">
            <li class="comb">A combination of alphabet characters (<b>a – z,</b> and <b>A – Z</b>) , numeric digits
                (<b>0 – 9</b>), and the underscores (_) can be used. <br>Identifiers or variables can
                be long; however, many systems consider the first 31 characters unique.
            </li>
                <li class="first-char">The <b>first character</b> in the name should <b>not</b> be a <b>numeric digit.</b>
                </li>
            <li class="embedded"><b>No embedded space/s</b> can be placed between the characters. This means you cannot
                separate words in a name by a space. <br>Normally you concentrate (append) second and subsequent
                words onto the identifier by capitalizing the second word.</li>
            <li class="descriptive">Being <b>descriptive</b> is helpful. Use meaningful names that represent the item being described. <br> If
                the identifier is used to reference a person’s age, call it age, not x. <br>The more descriptive your
                identifiers, the easier it is for you and others to read your code.</li>
        </ol>

            <p class="writing">WAYS in WRITING VARIABLE NAMES</p>
            <p class="proper">Proper variable naming in program is important. In connection with this, programmers are trained <br>to
                use proper variable declaration and use naming conventions for better understanding of computer programs.</p>
                <p class="ways">These are three ways in writing variable names:</p>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li class="pascal"><b>Pascal Case</b> – the first letter in the identifier and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated
                word are being capitalized. <br>
                <b>Ex. FamilyName, FirstName, MiddleInitial</b></li>
            <li class="camel"><b>Camel Case/Hungarian Notation</b> – the first letter of an identifier is
                lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated <br> word is capitalized.
                 <b>Ex. familyName, firstName, middleInitial</b></li>
            <li class="upper"><b>Uppercase </b> – variables or identifiers use capitalization of all of its characters
                <b>Ex. FAMILYNAME, FIRSTNAME, MIDDLEINITIAL</b>
                </li>
