                        <h1>What is a computer program?</h1><br>
                        <p>A computer program is a list of instructions arranged in some logical 
                            order, which completely specifies how the computer is to solve a particular problem 
                            or perform a specific task. The people who creates computer program are called 
                            programmers. <br> <br> Just as human beings communicate with each other using languages such as Filipino, 
                                English, or Chinese, programmers use a variety of special languages called programming 
                                languages, to communicate with the computer. The instructions in a program are stated using computer 
                                language such as C, Visual BASIC, JAVA and among others. Natural languages such as English and Filipino are not 
                                suitable to use in computer programming because of their ambiguity and lack of precision.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-content-two">
                        <h1>Programming Languages</h1><br>
                        <p>Writing a computer program requires the use of a programming 
                            language that the computer can understand. <br>  The native language of the computer is the machine 
                            language. This language is based on the binary low (0) and high (1) 
                            signals that flow within the computer machine’s circuits. Data and instructions in the 
                            machine level are all expressed in terms of combinations of 0’s and 1’s only. 
                        <br><br>Programming the computer using the machine language as it was actually  
                        done before could be very difficult. The use of abbreviations or mnemonics instead of  
                        pure 0’s and 1’s in assembly language only partly lessened the difficulty and it was 
                        still generally considered complicated to allow greater productivity. <br><br>
                        The use of English – like instructions in high – level procedural 
                        languages greatly facilitated the programming of the computer. Programs written 
                        in these languages are easier to understand and are no longer constrained by the kind 
                        of computer being programmed, thereby, making them portable to other kinds of 
                        computers. <br><br>The use of very high – level problem – oriented languages 
                        require only little training in programming because they are designed to solve specific 
                        problems. To make computer programming even a lot easier, programming is being 
                        developed to approach that of our natural languages. </p>

                            associated value may be changed. Variables are somewhat served as containers, which 
                           may contain values which are constant and which may be utilized, while the program is running 
                           or being executed.</p>

                                <li>The first character in the name should not be a numeric digit.</li>
                                <li>No embedded space/s can be placed between the characters. This means you cannot

                                <li>Being descriptive is helpful. Use meaningful names that represent the item being described. If 
                                    the identifier is used to reference a person’s age, call it age, not x. The more descriptive your 
                                    identifiers, the easier it is for you and others to read your code.</li>

                        <p>These three control structures are referred to as structured programming constructs. Any

                        <p>Algorithms written with only the sequence, selection, and repetition structures are called structured 
                            algorithms. The process of writing such algorithms is called structured programming and the 
                            resulting programs are called structured programs.</p>
                            <p>The selection structure and the repetition structure may also be viewed as tasks in a sequence structure. 
                            Hence, a program may be taken as a sequence of a mixture of sequence, selection and repetition structures. 
                            Note that there is always 1 entry point and 1 exit point in each structure. This gives us a way of

                        <h1>Collections & Arrays in C#</h1>
                        <p>In C#, data structures play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. Among the most fundamental and widely used structures are arrays and collections. While arrays provide a basic, fixed-size container for storing elements of the same type, collections offer more flexibility and functionality, allowing developers to handle dynamic data and perform complex operations. Understanding the differences and use cases of arrays and collections is essential for writing efficient and maintainable code in C#.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-content-one">
                        <h1>Arrays</h1>
                        <p>An array is a linear data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the same type. Arrays are indexed, meaning each element can be accessed using its position within the array. The zero-based indexing system makes arrays efficient for tasks where quick access to elements by position is required.</p><br>
                        <p>For example, a simple array of integers in C# can be declared and initialized as follows:
                            <br><br>int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
                        </p>
                        <p>Arrays in C# can be single-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Multi-dimensional arrays, like two-dimensional arrays, are useful for representing data in a grid or matrix form: <br>
                            int[,] matrix = { <br>
                            &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace;{ 1, 2, 3 },<br>
                            &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace;{ 4, 5, 6 },<br>
                            &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace; &ThickSpace;{ 7, 8, 9 }<br>
                            };</p>
                        <p>Although arrays provide fast access to elements, their main limitation is their fixed size. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed, which can lead to inefficient memory usage if the exact size of the data is unknown at compile time.</p>
